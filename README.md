# Where-s-My-Money
It's my money tracker app, with which you can, yep, track all your incomes and expenses.
You can have 3 money accounts with differens currency and initial amount of money. Every money account has initial category list, that can be fully changed: you can delete them, make new ones and redact every of them. The categories are divided into expense and income categories. 
All transactions can be sorted by time period (day/week/month/year/all time) and categories. You can see statistics (your current balance and all the expenses for current time period) on the screen with all transactions table view. All sections in table view are hideable (by day/month/category) with another little statistics in footer.
